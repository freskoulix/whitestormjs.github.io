### Building WhitestormJS

WhitestormJS can be built by installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), and the [gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp) package through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

After that, clone the repository anywhere you'd like (`git clone https://github.com/WhitestormJS/whitestorm.js.git`).

Open the new directory (`./WhitestormJS/` by default) using whatever terminal emulator you'd like.

You can build WhitestormJS with the following command: `npm run build`

WhitestormJS will be built, and written to `build/whitestorm.js`, and `build/whitestorm.compact.js`.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/WhitestormJS/whitestorm.js.git
$ cd whitestorm.js
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

### Committing

All engine code is in the `src/` folder.
Modules are in the `modules/`, each having their own build.

_We still in the process of moving all remaining modules from `src/` to `modules`. If you create a new module, please put it in the `modules` folder._

**Do not edit files in `build/` folder!!!*

#### Fixed Issue

- **Comment** - Your comment to commit. (optional, unless you have no code.)
- **Fix** - Example: `Fixed #25`. (If you fixed issue #25)

>**code must be UPPCERCASE, comment must be be Capitalized**

    - [XO](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo)
    - Wrap logical blocks* with newlines.

_logical blocks_* - lines that have something in common.
